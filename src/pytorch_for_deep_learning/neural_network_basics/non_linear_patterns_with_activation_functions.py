"""Modeling Non-Linear Patterns with Activation Functions

Welcome back to the delivery challenge!

In the last lab, your simple linear model performed well on bike-only data, but it struggled
when cars were added. The reason was simple: your model could only learn straight lines, but
the new data followed a curve. As you saw in the lectures, simply adding more linear neurons
is not the solution. The model's output would still be a straight line.

This is where non-linear activation functions come in. They are the key to unlocking your
model's ability to learn the complex, curved patterns found in real-world data. In this lab,
you'll use the most popular and powerful activation function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit),
to build a more sophisticated model. By adding a ReLU activation, your model can create
multiple "bends" that can approximate the complex delivery time curve.

In this lab, you will:

* Prepare the combined bike and car delivery data, this time applying a technique called
  normalization to help your model train more effectively.
* Build a non-linear neural network using the ReLU activation function.
* Train your new model to learn the complex, curved relationship in the data.
* Predict delivery times using your new model and see if it can finally succeed where the linear one failed."""

    # A New Step: Normalizing the Data
    #
    # Before building your model, you will apply a quick data preparation step called
    # normalization. This is a standard technique that makes the training process more stable
    # and effective by adjusting the scale of the data. This adjustment helps prevent large
    # distance values from dominating the learning process and keeps gradients stable during
    # training. You will explore this topic in greater detail in a later module.

    # You will calculate the mean and standard deviation for the distances and times tensors.
    # You will then apply standardization to each tensor using its respective mean and standard
    # deviation, which creates new normalized tensors named distances_norm and times_norm.
    # This specific technique is called standardization (or z-score normalization), which converts
    # the original data from 1.0 to 20.0 miles and approximately 7 to 93 minutes into a new,
    # normalized scale.

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the 'distances' tensor
    distances_mean = distances.mean()
    distances_std = distances.std()

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the 'times' tensor
    times_mean = times.mean()
    times_std = times.std()

    # Apply standardization to the distances.
    distances_norm = (distances - distances_mean) / distances_std

    # Apply standardization to the times.
    times_norm = (times - times_mean) / times_std

    # * You will notice the axes now show the data on a new, normalized scale, with distance
    #   ranging from approximately -1.7 to 1.7 and time from -2.0 to 1.0.
    # * Despite this change in scale, the underlying curved pattern of the data remains exactly
    #   the same.

    helper_utils.plot_data(distances_norm, times_norm, normalize=True)

    # Building the Non-Linear Model
    #
    # With your normalized data ready, you can now build a model capable of learning its curved
    # pattern. You will define the model's architecture, which now includes a ReLU activation
    # function. This structure is what gives your model the ability to learn non-linear
    # relationships.
    #
    # * nn.Linear(1, 3): This is your first hidden layer. It consists of three neurons, each
    #   receiving one input feature (the normalized distance). This layer transforms the single
    #   input value into three separate values.
    # * nn.ReLU() applies the ReLU activation function to the output of each of the three neurons
    #   from the hidden layer. This is the crucial non-linear step that allows your model to
    #   create "bends" and learn curves instead of just straight lines.
    # * nn.Linear(3, 1): This is your output layer. It takes the three activated values from the
    #   previous step as its input and combines them to produce a single final output, which is your predicted (normalized) delivery time.
    #
    # This creates a neural network with 1 hidden layer containing 3 neurons.

    # This line ensures that your results are reproducible and consistent every time.
    torch.manual_seed(27)

    model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(1, 3), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(3, 1))

    # Training
    #
    # * Define the loss function and the optimizer for training.

    # Define the loss function and optimizer
    loss_function = nn.MSELoss()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    # With your model and training tools ready, you can begin the training process.

    # * You will run the training loop for 3000 epochs (more than Lab 1 because the non-linear
    #   pattern is more complex and requires more training). This will repeatedly feed the
    #   normalized data to your model, measure the error, and adjust the model's parameters to
    #   improve its predictions.
    # * The second half of the code includes a live plot, allowing you to watch in real time as
    #   your model's prediction line adapts to fit the curved data. The live plot helps you see
    #   how your model gradually learns to fit the curve, starting with a poor fit and improving
    #   over time.
    #
    # IMPORTANT NOTE: As the plot updates in real time during training, you might notice a
    # flickering effect. This is the expected behavior of the live visualization and not an issue
    # with your screen.

    # * This lets you visually inspect how well your non-linear model learned to fit the complex
    #   data pattern.

    # Congratulations! You have successfully trained your first non-linear neural network in
    # PyTorch!

    # Where the simple linear model from the last lab failed, your new model with a ReLU
    # activation function succeeded. As you can see from the plot, your model learned to capture
    # the complex, curved relationship in the combined bike and car delivery data.
    #
    #
    # Making a Prediction
    #
    # With your fully trained non-linear model, you can now use it to make a prediction for a
    # new delivery. The process is slightly different now because your model was trained on
    # normalized data.

    # * First, you will take the new input distance and normalize it using the same mean and
    #   standard deviation from your training data. This step is CRITICAL: your model has no
    #   idea about the original scales (miles and minutes). It only understands the normalized
    #   scale it was trained on.
    # * After the model provides its prediction, you must de-normalize the output. This converts
    #   the prediction from its normalized scale back into an understandable value in minutes.
    # * Finally, the code uses this actual predicted time to run the decision logic. For this
    #   prediction, assume your company now promises deliveries within 45 minutes (instead of
    #   30 minutes from Lab 1) and wants to know which vehicle to use.

    distance_to_predict = 5.1

    # Use the torch.no_grad() context manager for efficient prediction
    with torch.no_grad():
        # Normalize the input distance
        distance_tensor = torch.tensor([[distance_to_predict]], dtype=torch.float32)
        new_distance_norm = (distance_tensor - distances_mean) / distances_std

        # Get the normalized prediction from the model
        predicted_time_norm = model(new_distance_norm)

        # De-normalize the output to get the actual time in minutes
        predicted_time_actual = (predicted_time_norm * times_std) + times_mean

        # --- Decision Making Logic ---
        print(
            f"Prediction for a {distance_to_predict}-mile delivery: {predicted_time_actual.item():.1f} minutes"
        )

        # First, check if the delivery is possible within the 45-minute timeframe
        if predicted_time_actual.item() > 45:
            print("\nDecision: Do NOT promise the delivery in under 45 minutes.")
        else:
            # If it is possible, then determine the vehicle based on the distance
            if distance_to_predict <= 3:
                print(
                    f"\nDecision: Yes, delivery is possible. Since the distance is {distance_to_predict} miles (<= 3 miles), use a bike."
                )
            else:
                print(
                    f"\nDecision: Yes, delivery is possible. Since the distance is {distance_to_predict} miles (> 3 miles), use a car."
                )

    # Conclusion
    #
    # You have now built and trained both a simple linear model and a more powerful non-linear
    # model in PyTorch. In this lab, you saw firsthand how adding a non-linear activation function
    # like ReLU gave your model the ability to succeed where the linear model had failed.
    #
    # You have moved beyond fitting straight lines and can now capture the complex, curved patterns
    # that are common in real-world data. You also learned a practical data preparation technique,
    # normalization, that helps make the training process more stable and effective.
    #
    # With these fundamental skills of building architectures, preparing data, and training
    # models, you are well prepared for the next step. In the upcoming module, you will build on
    # this foundation to tackle new kinds of problems, like classification, and dive even deeper
    # into the mechanics of how neural networks learn.
